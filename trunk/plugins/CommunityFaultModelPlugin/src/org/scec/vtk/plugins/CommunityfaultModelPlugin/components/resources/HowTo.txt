Troubleshooting:
If you're selecting groups and faults are not being highlighted, you need to 
exit the program WITHOUT removing the faults, and restart. Removing faults 
before exiting the program will disable groups during the next session. Also, 
be sure to give the imported faults the same Import Name that was used when 
creating the group(s).
